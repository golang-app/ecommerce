# Use frontend framework - ReactJS

## The problem

To write a frontend for the application we need to have a popular and easy to use framework.

## Why's behind the decision

I, as a backend engineer, don't have a lot of experience in frontend. ReactJS is very popular in many companies and I feel I'll benefit of learning it.
